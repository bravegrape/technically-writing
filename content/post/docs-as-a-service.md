I've recently bought Lou Downe's highly acclaimed book, Good Services.

{{< blockquote author ="Lou Downe, Good Services" >}}
A service is something that helps someone do something.

Since docs help developers build their integration/use an API/connect to something, I thought it would be interesting to see what I could learn from thinking of documentation as a service.

Lou's book talks about 15 principles of good service design so let's see how we could apply that to documentation:

{{< expandable label="1. Be easy to find" level="2" >}}

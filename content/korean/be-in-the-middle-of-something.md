## Use case

When talking about being in the middle of something, for example driving or making a cake.

A: 지금 뭐 해? What are you doing now?

B: 운전하는 중이야. I'm in the middle of driving

or

B: 운전 중아야.

In conversation, you can leave out the **이다** part.

## Construction

You need to add **중이다** to something that has noun value. You can give a verb noun value by adding **-는** to the verb stem.

Don't use **-기** to give a verb noun value. It sounds awkward with this construction.

### Noun

Add **중이다** after the noun.

출장 중이다.

### Verb with noun value
